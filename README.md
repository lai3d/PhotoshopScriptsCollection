Scripts written in JavaScript can be accessed from the Adobe Photoshop Scripts menu (File > Scripts), which provides quick and easy access to your JavaScripts. By putting a JavaScript file into the appropriate location on disk, it can be accessed directly from the Photoshop menu.
To install a JavaScript in the Scripts menu, place it in the Scripts folder (Photoshop CC 2015/Presets /Scripts). The names of the scripts in the Scripts folder, without the file name extension, are displayed in the Scripts menu. Any number of scripts may be installed in the Scripts menu.Scripts added to the Scripts folder while Photoshop is running do not appear in the Scripts menu until the next time you launch the application.
All scripts found in the Scripts folder and sub-folders are displayed at the top level of the File > Scripts menu. The addition of sub-folders does not add a hierarchical organization to the Scripts menu.
